=head1 Name

yval - Validator, Translator and Formatter for YAML, JSON, and Others

=head1 Synopsis

      # Check if a YAML file is well-formed:
      > yval file.yaml
      # Validate a YAML file against a schema:
      > yval file.yaml --schema=myformat.schemat
      # Validate a YAML file against a schema:
      > yval file.yaml --schema=myformat.schemat

=head1 Description

The C<yval> tool is a validator, translator and formatter for YAML, JSON, CSV
and TSV data.

=head1 Installation

The C<yval> command is currently written in NodeJS. To install it, run:

      > npm install -g yval

=head1 Usage

The C<yval> command takes a data file as input and:

=over

=item * With no options, loads it and reports whether it is well-formed

=item * With C<--schema=...> option will lint/validate it against a schema

=item * With C<--to=...> option will write data to stdout in the specified format

=back

If input data is valid, C<yval> will return C<0> as the exit code; else it
will return C<1>.

=head1 Command Options

The C<yval> command has the following options:

=over

=item * C<-s>, C<< --schema=<file> >>

To use C<yval> as a linter/validator, specify a schema file. Supports the
C<schemat> and C<json-schema> formats. See Below.

=item * C<-t>, C<< --to=<format> >>

With this option, C<yval> will format the input data into the specified format
and write it to stdout. Valid formats are: C<yaml>, C<json>, C<csv> and
C<tsv>. This option can be used along with the C<--schema> option.

=item * C<-f>, C<< --from=<format> >>

Explicitly specify the input format. Usually C<yval> can correctly guess the
input format. Use this option when it can't. Valid formats are: C<yaml>,
C<json>, C<csv> and C<tsv>. This option can be used along with the C<--
schema> option.

=item * C<-q>, C<--quiet>

Suppress all validation output. Use this when you only care about the
translation output, and/or the C<yval> exit code.
